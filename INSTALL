GTK+ 3.0 library headers and Make are required to build this project. 
Glade is needed to edit the user interface. GCC or Clang is probably 
required. This hasn’t been tested with Windows and probably isn’t 
portable there yet.

Install GTK headers on Debian or Ubuntu based linux distro:

$ sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
$ sudo apt install glade

Then to install, simply enter this directory and run:

$ sudo make install
